# Work Item Workflow Efficiency

This Extension will give you a new hub in your Work Item that will report on your team's work item average time spent in your board columns.  It will also let you categorize your board columns in to "Wait" columns and "Work" columns, which will give your team, scrum masters, and agile coaches insight in to how much time on average your work items spend waiting on something vs. how long they are being worked on.

You can select a team, and a time frame and a board level (Requirement (PBIs, User Story etc..), Epic, Feature etc.. The report will then do the follow:

Query your work items to find work items found on the team's backlog area path(s) that have been completed in the timeframe chosen by the date selection.

Takes all of those work items returned by the query, and examines the history to find how long each work item has spent in a give Board Column

Averages the time Work Items spent in each column found in the history

Users can select Board Columns to then be a "Work" or a "Wait" column so you can see the average Wait vs. Work time for your work items.



This extension looks at your team project's process template, so it will take in to account customizations to the process template to judge what work items fall in to your backlog, as well as getting things like what the "Completed" work item state is ("Closed", or "Done" or whatever you've customized).
